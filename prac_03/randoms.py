# Answering the questions in comments:
# 1. The smallest number on line 1 could be 5, the largest 20.
# 2. The smallest number on line 2 could be 3, the largest 9, and no, line 2 could not have produced a 4.
# 3. The smallest number on line 3 could be 2.5, the largest 5.5.

# Producing a random number between 1 and 100 inclusive:
