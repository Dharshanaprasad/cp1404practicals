# Reflection – Practical 2

**1. What did you learn about functions this week?**  
I learned that functions should do one job only (SRP). We can reuse them in different places which makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

**2. What was the hardest part?**  
The hardest part was structuring the menu code and making sure it didn’t break. It took a few tries to keep the code organised using functions.

**3. What did you enjoy or do well?**  
I liked working with random scores and converting temperatures. I also did well using functions properly instead of just putting everything inside `main()`.

**4. What would you change or do better next time?**  
Next time I will plan my functions first before writing the main code. That should make things faster and more organised.

**5. How do you feel about using Git and GitHub?**  
Git is a bit tricky at first but I see how it helps to save versions. I’m slowly getting used to committing and pushing my work to GitHub.
